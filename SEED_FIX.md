# 🔧 Seed Script Fix - User Class Field

## 🐛 Issue

When running the seed script, it failed with:
```
❌ SEEDING ERROR: User validation failed: class: Path `class` is required.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `User` model requires a `class` field for all users with role='student':

```javascript
class: {
  type: String,
  required: function() {
    return this.role === 'student';  // Required for students only
  },
  trim: true
}
```

The seed script was creating student users without providing the `class` field.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Added the `class` field to all student user creation in `backend/seed-comprehensive.js`:

### CSE Section A Students
```javascript
const studentUser = new User({
  name: studentData.name,
  email: studentData.email,
  password: 'student123',
  role: 'student',
  department: 'CSE',
  class: '2023-2027_2nd Year_3_A',  // ✅ Added
  phone: studentData.mobile,
  createdBy: facultyUser1._id
});
```

### CSE Section B Students
```javascript
class: '2023-2027_2nd Year_3_B'  // ✅ Added
```

### IT Section A Students
```javascript
class: '2024-2028_1st Year_1_A'  // ✅ Added
```

## 🎯 Class Field Format

The class field follows this format:
```
{batchYear}_{year}_{semester}_{section}
```

Examples:
- `2023-2027_2nd Year_3_A` - CSE 2nd Year, Semester 3, Section A
- `2023-2027_2nd Year_3_B` - CSE 2nd Year, Semester 3, Section B
- `2024-2028_1st Year_1_A` - IT 1st Year, Semester 1, Section A

This format matches the `classId` format used in the Student model's semesters array.

## ✅ Status

**Fixed!** The seed script now:
- ✅ Provides required `class` field for all students
- ✅ Uses correct class format matching system conventions
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Ready to run

## 🚀 How to Use

Simply run the seed script again:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:all
```

Expected output:
```
